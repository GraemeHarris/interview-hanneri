Contrast-\nenhanced MRI can commence immediately afterwards (shortly after the injection \ndepending on the pulse sequences used and the protocol for the examination). \nOptimal signal enhancement is observed during arterial first pass for CE-MRA and \nwithin a period of about 15 minutes after injection of Gadobutrol for CNS indications \n(time depending on type of lesion/tissue).  \nT1-weighted scanning sequences are particularly suitable for contrast-enhanced \nexaminations.  \nIntravascular administration of contrast media should, if possible, be done with the \npatient lying down. After the administration, the patient should be kept under \nobservation for at least 30 minutes, since experience shows that the majority of \nundesirable effects occur within this time (see section 4.4). \n \nInstructions for use\n \nThis product is intended for single use only. \nThis medicinal product should be visually inspected before use. \n\nGadobutrol should not be used in case of severe discolouration, the occurrence of \nparticulate matter or a defective container. \nThe prefilled syringe must be taken from the pack and prepared for the injection \nimmediately before the administration. \nThe tip cap should be removed from the prefilled syringe immediately before use. \n \nPosology\n \nThe lowest dose that provides sufficient enhancement for diagnostic purposes should \nbe used. The dose should be calculated based on the patient’s body weight, and \nshould not exceed the recommended dose per kilogram of body weight detailed in \nthis section. \n \nAdults  \nCNS indications: \nThe recommended dose for adults is 0.1 mmol per kilogram body weight (mmol/kg \nBW). This is equivalent to 0.1 ml/kg BW of the 1.0 M solution. \nIf a strong clinical suspicion of a lesion persists despite an unremarkable MRI or \nwhen more accurate information might influence therapy of the patient, a further \ninjection of up to 0.2 ml/kg BW within 30 minutes of the first injection may be \nperformed. \nA dose of 0.075 mmol Gadobutrol per kg body weight (equivalent to 0.075 ml \nGadobutrol per kg body weight) may be administered at minimum for imaging of the \nCNS (see section 5.1). \n \nWhole Body MRI (except MRA): \nIn general, the administration of 0.1 ml Gadobutrol per kg body weight is sufficient to \nanswer the clinical question. \n \nCE-MRA: \nImaging of 1 field of view (FOV): 7.5 ml for body weight below 75 kg; 10 ml for \nbody weight of 75 kg and higher (corresponding to 0.1-0.15 mmol/kg BW). \n \nImaging of >1 field of view (FOV): 15 ml for body weight below 75 kg; 20 ml for \nbody weight of 75 kg and higher (corresponding to 0.2-0.3 mmol/kg BW). \n \nSpecial populations \n \nRenal impairment: \nGadobutrol should only be used in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 \nml/min/1.73 m\n2\n) and in patients in the perioperative liver transplantation period after \ncareful risk/benefit assessment and if the diagnostic information is essential and not \navailable with non-contrast enhanced MRI (see section 4.4). If it is necessary to use \nGadobutrol, the dose should not exceed 0.1 mmol/kg body weight. More than one \n\ndose should not be used during a scan. Because of the lack of information on repeated \nadministration, Gadobutrol injections should not be repeated unless the interval \nbetween injections is at least 7 days. \n \nPaediatric population:  \nFor children of all ages (including term neonates) the recommended dose is 0.1 mmol \nGadobutrol per kg body weight (equivalent to 0.1 ml Gadobutrol per kg body weight) \nfor all indications (see section 4.1). \n \nNeonates up to 4 weeks of age and infants up to 1 year of age:  \nDue to immature renal function in neonates up to 4 weeks of age and infants up to 1 \nyear of age, Gadobutrol should only be used in these patients after careful \nconsideration at a dose not exceeding 0.1 mmol/kg body weight. More than one dose \nshould not be used during a scan. Because of the lack of information on repeated \nadministration, Gadobutrol injections should not be repeated unless the interval \nbetween injections is at least 7 days. \n \nElderly (aged 65 years and above): \nNo dosage adjustment is considered necessary. Caution should be exercised in elderly \npatients (see section 4.4). \n \n \n4.3       Contraindications       \n \nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section \n6.1. \n \n \n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \n \nGadobutrol must not be used intrathecally. Serious, life-threatening and fatal cases, \nprimarily with neurological reactions (e.g. coma, encephalopathy, seizures), have \nbeen reported with intrathecal use. \nWhile injecting Gadobutrol into veins with a small lumen there is the possibility of \nadverse effects such as reddening and swelling. \nThe usual safety requirements for magnetic resonance imaging, especially the \nexclusion of ferromagnetic materials, also apply when using Gadobutrol. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions or other idiosyncratic reactions\n \nAs with other intravenous contrast agents, Gadobutrol can be associated with \nanaphylactoid/hypersensitivity or other idiosyncratic reactions (e.g., acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome / pulmonary oedema with and without the context of \n\nhypersensitivity reactions), characterised by cardiovascular, respiratory or cutaneous \nmanifestations, and ranging to severe reactions including shock. In general, patients \nwith cardiovascular disease are more susceptible to serious or even fatal outcomes of \nsevere hypersensitivity reactions. \nThe risk of hypersensitivity reactions may be higher in case of: \n⎯ previous reaction to contrast media \n⎯ history of bronchial asthma \n⎯ history of allergic disorders \nIn patients with an allergic disposition the decision to use Gadobutrol must be made \nafter particularly careful evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio. \nMost of these reactions occur within half an hour of administration. Therefore, post-\nprocedure observation of the patient is recommended. \nMedication for the treatment of hypersensitivity or other idiosyncratic reactions as \nwell as preparedness for institution of emergency measures are necessary (see section \n4.2). \nDelayed reactions (after hours up to several days) have been rarely observed (see \nsection 4.8). \n \nImpaired renal function\n \nPrior to administration of Gadobutrol, it is recommended that all patients are screened \nfor renal dysfunction by obtaining laboratory tests.  \nThere have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with use \nof some gadolinium-containing contrast agents in patients with acute or chronic \nsevere renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). Patients undergoing liver \ntransplantation are at particular risk since the incidence of acute renal failure is high \nin this group.  \nAs there is a possibility that NSF may occur with Gadobutrol, it should therefore only \nbe used in patients with severe renal impairment and in patients in the perioperative \nliver transplantation period after careful risk/benefit assessment and if the diagnostic \ninformation is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced magnetic \nresonance imaging (MRI). \nHaemodialysis shortly after Gadobutrol administration may be useful at removing \nGadobutrol from the body. There is no evidence to support the initiation of \nhaemodialysis for prevention or treatment of NSF in patients not already undergoing \nhaemodialysis. \n \nNeonates and infants \n \nDue to immature renal function in neonates up to 4 weeks of age and infants up to 1 \nyear of age, Gadobutrol should only be used in these patients after careful \nconsideration. \n \nElderly \n \nAs the renal clearance of Gadobutrol may be impaired in the elderly, it is particularly \nimportant to screen patients aged 65 years and older for renal dysfunction. \n \n\nSeizure disorders \nLike with other gadolinium containing contrast agents special precaution is necessary \nin patients with a low threshold for seizures. \n \nExcipients \n \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose (based on \nthe average amount given to a 70 kg person), i.e. essentially “sodium-free”. \n \n \n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nNo interaction studies have been performed. \n \n \n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nData from the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents including gadobutrol in \npregnant women are limited. Gadolinium can cross the placenta. It is unknown \nwhether exposure to gadolinium is associated with adverse effects in the foetus. \nAnimal studies have shown reproductive toxicity at repeated high doses (see section \n5.3).  \nGadobutrol should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the \nwoman requires use of gadobutrol. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nGadolinium-containing contrast agents are excreted into breast milk in very small \namounts (see section 5.3). At clinical doses, no effects on the infant are anticipated \ndue to the small amount excreted in milk and poor absorption from the gut. \nContinuing or discontinuing of breast feeding for a period of 24 hours after \nadministration of Gadobutrol, should be at the discretion of the doctor and lactating \nmother. \n \nFertility \n \nAnimal studies do not indicate impairment of fertility. \n \n \n4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nNot relevant. \n\n \n \n4.8       Undesirable       effects       \n \nThe overall safety profile of Gadobutrol is based on data from more than 6,300 \npatients in clinical trials and from post-marketing surveillance.  \nThe most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (\n≥ 0.5 %) in patients receiving \nGadobutrol are headache, nausea and dizziness.  \nThe most serious adverse drug reactions in patients receiving Gadobutrol are cardiac \narrest, acute respiratory distress syndrome / pulmonary oedema and severe \nanaphylactoid reactions (including respiratory arrest and anaphylactic shock). \nDelayed anaphylactoid or other idiosyncratic reactions (hours later up to several days) \nhave been rarely observed (see section 4.4). \nMost of the undesirable effects were of mild to moderate intensity. \nThe adverse drug reactions observed with Gadobutrol are represented in the table \nbelow. They are classified according to System Organ Class (MedDRA). The most \nappropriate MedDRA term is used to describe a certain reaction and its synonyms and \nrelated conditions.  \nAdverse drug reactions from clinical trials are classified according to their \nfrequencies. Frequency groupings are defined according to the following convention:  \nCommon (\n≥ 1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to \n<1/1,000). The adverse drug reactions identified only during post-marketing \nsurveillance, and for which a frequency could not be estimated, are listed under “not \nknown”.  \nWithin each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of \ndecreasing seriousness.  \n \nTable 1.

This has been confirmed in a phase IV \nstudy including more than 1,100 paediatric patients and postmarketing surveillance. \n \n\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is \nimportant. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal \nproduct. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions \nvia the Yellow Card Scheme at: www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard\n or search for MHRA \nYellow Card on the Google Play or Apple App Store. \n \n \n4.9       Overdose       \n \nThe maximum daily single dose tested in humans is 1.5 mmol gadobutrol/kg body \nweight. No signs of intoxication from an overdose have so far been reported during \nclinical use. \nIn case of inadvertent overdosage, cardiovascular monitoring (including ECG) and \ncontrol of renal function is recommended as a measure of precaution. \nIn case of overdose in patients with renal insufficiency, Gadobutrol can be removed \nby haemodialysis. After 3 haemodialysis sessions approx. 98 % of the agent are \nremoved from the body. However, there is no evidence that haemodialysis is suitable \nfor prevention of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). \n \n \n5        PHARMACOLOGICAL        PROPERTIES        \n \n5.1       Pharmacodynamic       properties       \n \nPharmacotherapeutic group:  paramagnetic contrast media, ATC Code: V08\nСА09. \n \nMechanism of action\n \nThe contrast-enhancing effect is mediated by gadobutrol, the non-ionic complex \nconsisting of gadolinium (III) and the macrocyclic ligand dihydroxy-\nhydroxymethylpropyl-tetraazacyclododecane-triacetic acid (butrol). \n \nPharmacodynamic effects\n \nThe relaxivity of gadobutrol, measured in vitro in human blood/plasma at \nphysiological conditions and at clinically relevant field strengths (1.5 and 3.0 T), is in \nthe range of 3.47 - 4.97 L/mmol/sec. \nIn clinical doses, the pronounced relaxivity of gadobutrol leads to a shortening of the \nrelaxation times of protons in tissue water. \nThe stability of the gadobutrol complex has been studied in vitro at physiological \nconditions (in native human serum, at pH 7.4 and 37°C) over the time period of 15 \ndays. The amounts of released gadolinium ions from gadobutrol were below the limit \n\nof quantification of 0.1 mol% of total gadolinium demonstrating the high complex \nstability of gadobutrol under the tested conditions. \n \nClinical efficacy\n \nIn a pivotal phase III liver study average sensitivity in combined pre and post-contrast \nMRI for gadobutrol-treated patients was 79 % and specificity was 81 % for lesion \ndetection and classification of suspected malignant liver lesions (patient-based \nanalysis). \nIn a pivotal phase III kidney study average sensitivity was 91 % (patient-based \nanalysis) and 85 % (lesion-based analysis) for classification of malignant and benign \nrenal lesions. Average specificity in a patient-based analysis was 52 % and in a \nlesion-based analysis 82 %. \nThe increase of sensitivity from pre-contrast to combined pre and post-contrast MRI \nfor gadobutrol-treated patients was 33 % in the liver study (patient-based analysis) \nand 18 % in the kidney study (patient-based analysis as well as lesion-based analysis). \nThe increase in specificity from pre-contrast to combined pre and post-contrast MRI \nwas 9 % in the liver study (patient-based analysis) while there was no increase in \nspecificity in the kidney study (patient-based analysis as well as lesion-based \nanalysis).  \nAll results are average results obtained in blinded reader studies.  \nIn a study designed as an intra-individual, crossover comparison, gadobutrol was \ncompared to gadoterate meglumine (both at 0.1 mmol/kg) in the visualization of \ncerebral neoplastic enhancing lesions in 132 patients. \nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the overall preference for either gadobutrol or \ngadoterate meglumine by the median blinded reader. Superiority of gadobutrol was \ndemonstrated by a p-value of 0.0004. In detail, a preference of gadobutrol was given \nfor 42 patients (32 %) compared to an overall preference for gadoterate meglumine \nfor 16 patients (12 %). For 74 patients (56 %) no preference for one or the other \ncontrast agent was given. \nFor the secondary variables lesion-to-brain ratio was found to be statistically \nsignificantly higher for gadobutrol (p < 0.0003). Percent of enhancement was higher \nwith gadobutrol compared to gadoterate meglumine, with a statistically significant \ndifference for the blinded reader (p < 0.0003). \nContrast-to-noise ratio, showed a higher mean value following gadobutrol (129) \ncompared to gadoterate meglumine (98). The difference was not statistically \nsignificant. \nIn a study designed as an intra-individual, crossover comparison, gadobutrol at a \nreduced dose of 0.075 mmol/kg was compared to gadoterate meglumine at its \nstandard dose of 0.1 mmol/kg for contrast enhanced MRI of the CNS in 141 patients \nwith enhancing CNS lesions on gadoterate meglumine enhanced MRI. The primary \nvariables included lesion contrast enhancement, lesion morphology, and lesion border \ndelineation. Images were analysed by three independent blinded readers. \nNoninferiority to gadoterate meglumine for the degree of improvement over \nunenhanced imaging was demonstrated for all three primary variables (at least 80% of \neffect retained) based on the average reader. The mean number of lesions detected by \ngadobutrol (2.14) and gadoterate (2.06) were similar. \n \nPaediatric population  \n \n\nTwo single dose phase I/III studies in 138 paediatric subjects scheduled for CE-MRI \nof CNS, liver and kidneys or CE-MRA and in 44 subjects aged 0 -< 2 years \n(including term neonates) scheduled to undergo routine CE-MRI of any body region \nhave been performed. Diagnostic efficacy and an increase in diagnostic confidence \nwas demonstrated for all parameters evaluated in the studies and there was no \ndifference among the paediatric age groups and when compared to adults. Gadobutrol \nwas well tolerated in these studies with the same safety profile of gadobutrol as in \nadults. \n \nClinical safety\n \nThe type and frequency of adverse reactions following the administration of \ngadobutrol in various indications was evaluated in a large international prospective \nnon-interventional trial (GARDIAN). The safety population encompassed 23,708 \npatients of all age groups including children (n = 1,142; 4.8%) and elderly (n = 4,330; \n18.3% between the ages of 65 and < 80 and n = 526; 2.2% of \n≥ 80 years of age). \nMedian age was 51.9 years.  \nTwo hundred and two patients (0.9 %) reported overall 251 adverse events (AEs), and \n170 (0.7%) reported 215 events categorized as adverse drug reactions (ADRs), the \nmajority (97.7%) of which were mild or moderate in intensity. Most commonly \ndocumented ADRs were nausea (0.3 %), vomiting (0.1 %) and dizziness (0.1 %). \nADR rates were 0.9 % in females and 0.6 % in males. There were no differences in \nADR rates according to the dose of gadobutrol. Four of the 170 patients with ADRs \n(0.02 %) experienced a serious adverse event, with one event (Anaphylactic shock) \nleading to fatal outcome. In the paediatric population AEs were reported in 8 of the \n1,142 (0.7%) children. In six children these AEs were classified as ADRs (0.5%). \n \nRenal impairment \n \nIn a prospective pharmacoepidemiologic study (GRIP) to assess the magnitude of \npotential risk for development of NSF in renally impaired patients, 908 patients with \nvarying degrees of renal impairment received gadobutrol at the standard approved \ndose for CE-MRI. All patients, including 234 with severe renal impairment (eGFR \n<30 mL/min/1.73 m2) who had not received other GBCAs were followed over the \ncourse of two years for signs and symptoms of NSF. No patient enrolled in the study \ndeveloped NSF. \n \n \n5.2       Pharmacokinetic       properties       \n \nDistribution\n \nAfter intravenous administration, gadobutrol is rapidly distributed in the extracellular \nspace. Plasma protein binding is negligible. The pharmacokinetics of gadobutrol in \nhumans are dose proportional. After doses up to 0.4 mmol gadobutrol/kg body \nweight, the plasma level declines in a biphasic manner. At a dose of 0.1 mmol \ngadobutrol/kg BW, an average of 0.59 mmol gadobutrol/l plasma was measured 2 \nminutes after the injection and 0.3 mmol gadobutrol/l plasma 60 minutes post \ninjection. \n \n\nBiotransformation \nNo metabolites are detected in plasma or urine. \n \nElimination\n \nWithin two hours more than 50 % and within 12 hours more than 90 % of the given \ndose is eliminated via urine with a mean terminal half-life of 1.8 hours (1.3 - 2.1 \nhours), corresponding to the renal elimination rate. At a dose of 0.1 mmol \ngadobutrol/kg BW, an average of 100.3 ± 2.6 % of the dose was excreted within 72 h \nafter administration. In healthy persons renal clearance of gadobutrol is 1.1 to 1.7 ml \nmin\n-1\n kg\n-1\n and thus comparable to the renal clearance of inulin, pointing to the fact \nthat gadobutrol is eliminated primarily by glomerular filtration. Less than 0.1 % of \nthe dose is eliminated via faeces. \n \nCharacteristics in special patient populations\n \nPaediatric population\n \nPharmacokinetics of gadobutrol in paediatric population aged < 18 years and in adults \nare similar (see section 4.2). \nTwo single dose phase I/III studies in paediatric patients < 18 years have been \nperformed. The pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 130 paediatric patients aged 2 -< \n18 years and in 43 paediatric patients <2 years of age (including term neonates). \nIt was shown that the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of gadobutrol in children of all \nages is similar to that in adults resulting in similar values for area under the curve \n(AUC), body weight normalized plasma clearance (CLtot) and volume of distribution \n(Vss), as well as elimination half-life and excretion rate. \nApproximately 99% (median value) of the dose was recovered in urine within 6 hours \n(this information was derived from the 2 to <18 year old age group). \n \nElderly (aged 65 years and above)\n \nDue to physiological changes in renal function with age, in elderly healthy volunteers \n(aged 65 years and above) systemic exposure was increased by approximately 33 % \n(men) and 54 % (women) and terminal half-life by approximately 33 % (men) and 58 \n% (women). The plasma clearance is reduced by approximately 25 % (men) and 35 % \n(women), respectively. The recovery of the administered dose in urine was complete \nafter 24 h in all volunteers and there was no difference between elderly and non-\nelderly healthy volunteers. \n \nRenal impairment\n \nIn patients with impaired renal function, the serum half-life of gadobutrol is \nprolonged due to the reduced glomerular filtration. The mean terminal half-life was \nprolonged to 5.8 hours in moderately impaired patients (80>CLCR>30 ml/min) and \nfurther prolonged to 17.6 hours in severely impaired patients not on dialysis \n(CLCR<30 ml/min). The mean serum clearance was reduced to 0.49 ml/min/kg in \nmild to moderately impaired patients (80>CLCR>30 ml/min) and to 0.16 ml/min/kg \nin severely impaired patients not on dialysis (CLCR<30 ml/min). \nComplete recovery in the urine was seen in patients with mild or moderate renal \nimpairment within 72 hours. In patients with severely impaired renal function about \n\n80 % of the administered dose was recovered in the urine within 5 days (see also \nsections 4.2 and 4.4). In patients requiring dialysis, gadobutrol was almost completely \nremoved from serum after the third dialysis. \n \n \n5.3 Preclinical safety data \n \nPreclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of \nsafety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. \nRepeated intravenous treatment in reproductive toxicology studies caused a \nretardation of embryonal development in rats and rabbits and an increase in \nembryolethality in rats, rabbits and monkeys at dose levels being 8 to 16 times (based \non body surface area) or 25 to 50 times (based on body weight) above the diagnostic \ndose in humans. It is not known whether these effects can also be induced by a single \nadministration. Single and repeat-dose toxicity studies in neonatal and juvenile rats \ndid not reveal findings suggestive of a specific risk for use in children of all ages \nincluding term neonates and infants. \nRadioactively labelled gadobutrol administered intravenously to lactating rats was \ntransferred to the neonates via milk at less than 0.1 % of the administered dose. \nIn rats, absorption after oral administration was found to be very small and amounted \nto about 5 % based on the fraction of the dose excreted in urine. \nIn preclinical cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies, depending on the dose \nadministered, transient increases in blood pressure and myocardial contractility were \nobserved. These effects have not been observed in humans. \nEnvironmental studies have shown that persistence and mobility of GBCAs indicates \na potential for distribution in the water column and possibly into groundwater. \n \n \n6        PHARMACEUTICAL        PARTICULARS        \n \n6.1 List of excipients \n \nCalcobutrol sodium  \nTrometamol \nHydrochloric acid, dilute \nWater for injection \n \n \n6.2       Incompatibilities       \n \n\nIn the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed \nwith other medicinal products. \n \n \n6.3       Shelf       life       \n \n3 years \n \nShelf life after first opening of the container:  \nAny solution for injection not used in one examination must be discarded.  \nChemical, physical and microbiological in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 \nhours at 20-25°C.
